#1 - Move more of the fe-* code to common.

#2 - Generalized fe-api, make the fe-* codesize minimal.
  (add ncurses, win32 ui)

#3 - Ability to connect to a existing session.

#4 - General cleanups.

#5 - Fix the plugin api to meet the new internal API
  Add ruby support?
  (Isomer)

#6 - Add ui in xchat to modify scripts on the fly.

#7 - Write some useful plugins using the API demonstrating it's features,
  and flexibility to be distributed with Rage

  Maybe a fully fledged !find "client"
  Maybe move some hardcoded things into plugins (eg, /mop,/mdeop etc)

#8 -  Move the hook code to a map<hook_name,list<hooks>>
  Made into a array of linked lists. (pomac)

#9 - Look at the http://xchat-gnome.navi.cx/ people, perhaps get them onboard?

#10 - UTF8 BOM support?
  (Isomer)
 
#11 - Profile code and look for obvious bottlenecks.

#12 - 005 needs to be a map<005name,value>
  005 is now a splay db. (pomac)

#13 - once 005 update is done, add support for WALLCHOPS, WALLVOICES, CPRIVMSG,
  CNOTICE.
  Fixed. (pomac)

#14 - Event theming
  (Isomer)

#15 - DCC queue, Set max simultaneus dccs to one user. Also allows us to add dirs
to be sent.

#16 - CTCP/DCC Throtteling.
  (pomac)

#17 - New channel/user db structure.

#18 - Add formating to the SIGNAL text system.

#19 - Propper flood detection system, ffs. =)

#20 - Replace all strncpy() calls by some custom stccpy()

#21 - strtok() shouldn't be used

#22 - there are various strlen() performed on the same string, eg:
1114691888.928020 strtok("zapek", ",")                                                         = "zapek"
1114691888.928133 strlen("zapek")                                                              = 5
1114691888.928213 strlen("zapek")                                                              = 5

#23 - strcasecmp("ISO-8859-15", "UTF8") performed on every refresh, that's unecessary

#24 - add ispell/aspell support in the input string with settable language depending on the channel
(or an heuristic to find out which language to use)
