XChat-Ruby Plugin
-----------------

v1.1: 8 Aug 2003
  - Fixed bugs that caused priorities to not be respected, and caused hooks
    with the same name to conflict (the older hook was being removed).  Hook
    return codes should now be understood correctly as well.
  - Made the internal ruby code more 1.8-compliant.  This should have zero
    effect if you only have 1.6.x installed, though.

v1.0.1: 9 June 2003
  Very minor modifications in order to support compilation under Win32.

v1.0: 9 June 2003
  Initial release.
